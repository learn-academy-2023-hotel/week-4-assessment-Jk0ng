# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: virtual DOM is like a carbon copy of the visualization of code. It's main purpose is to listen for any changes made and compare to the actualy DOM in object-oriented programming. This allows the webside to load only the compoments on which changes take place on. 

Researched answer: vitual DOm stand for virtual Document Object Model. It a carbon copy of the actual DOM and listens for any changes made from users. After detecting changes made on the virtual DOM, React reconcilate the differences between virtual DOM and DOM and find the most efficient way to update those changes without re-rendering the entire web-page. The like button on social media post is a prime example for that. 

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: that means even when "return" is not called, the last line of action will get printed out automatically

Researched answer: that means when writing customized method in Ruby, although "return" command can be used, it is not necessary to include "return" to print out the last line of method. Ruby automatically returns that if the keyword "return" is included. 

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer:
Difference#1: Ruby is an OOP, so everything in Ruby is an object. Whereas JavaScript stored data in different data types 
Difference#3: Because Ruby is an OOP and has local scope, it takes inheritance from superclass to connect objects, whereas JavaScript had either local or global scope. 
Difference#2: How to create obejects in Ruby is different from JavaScript. Also, Ruby has more easily accessible built-in methods

Common#1:Both utilize logic to create functions/methods
Common#2:Both can create objects 
Common#3: Both are programming langauges 

Researched answer:

Difference#1: JavaScript has different syntax than Ruby. JavaScript uses "{}", but Ruby doesn't. 
Difference#2: Ruby is purely an OOP, and everything is an object in Ruby. For JavaScript, it has both object oriented and functional programming. 
Difference#3:Ruby uses snake_case, but JavaScrip uses camelCase

Common#1: both Ruby and JavaScript are dynamically typed. That means varibles' names can be changed through the course as long as prior to running the program. 
Common#2: both langauges share similar data types
Common#3: both can be used for back-end development 

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: a version manager keeps all the necessary code snippets in the right place after downloading them. For example, yarn is a version mangaer that downloads and organizes the dependecies
 ^^^^^^WRONG

Researched answer: A version manager allows users to have the required version of programming language. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: RSpec stands for Ruby specification. It is a testing langauge used to test the behaviors of objects in Ruby. RSpec allows users to create specifications to describe the desired output. 

2. Test-driven development: TDD is the process of utilizing test by setting the test to fail first, and then pass in functions that will pass the test to develop valid code. 

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
Create means adding information to the database. For example, creating a username and storing it to the database is under the concept of create 
Read means displaying the data in a visual form. This means the user can see their username saved next time they loggin to the website. 
Update means modifying the existing data. For example, users should have the options to change their usernames. 
Delete means that the data can be removed from the database based on command. This allows users to delete their account based on their preference.
